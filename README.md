# How to install the discord bot?
# Downloading Node JS and All the packages.
1. [Download latest version of Node JS.](https://nodejs.org/en)
2. Download this repo from above as a zip.
3. Extract all the files of the zip folder from the repo.
4. Open a command prompt or the version of command prompt you have on your os. Direct it to he extracted files folder and run `npm install` to install the packages
# Getting your Discord API Key.
1. [Create a Discord Account if you havent.](https://discord.gg)
2. [Go to the Developer Settings page and create a new application.](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
3. Name your application anything you would like. Note this is going to be the bot name.
4. Agree to the terms of service.
5. On the web page look to your left and find the settings. In the settings there should be something called "Bot". Click that.![AltText](https://i.imgur.com/u5h7KOp.png)
6. Click Build A Bot.
7. Then you want to click Reset Token.
8. A Token should appear. Click Copy Token or Select the Token and click Copy.
9. Go to the extracted folder and find `app.js` file with your IDE. I suggest Visual Studio Code. 
10. Where it says `const client_key = ""` in the speech marks put in your key there.
11. Open a terminal in your IDE and do `nodemon app.js`.
If you have any concerns I suggest joining [the support discord.js server for help](https://discord.gg/djs)
